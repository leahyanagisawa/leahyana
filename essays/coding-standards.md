It is very easy to be lazy and say: well it doesn't matter how I got here, as long as I did it. As easy as it is to not care about the quality we put into our work, it is so important that we do adhere to some standard we or others hold to our work. In coding, some are quick to say "as long as my code works, it doesn't matter what it looks like!" To software engineers, however, it does. Coding standards are in place to hold individuals accountable for the work they produce. Not only does it help you, the coder, understand programming languages better, but it also helps others to see what your intent was with ease. Coding standards allow software engineers to build efficient code, that can even be used for more than one specific issue sometimes.
