<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Coming into ICS 314, I had very little coding experience and knowledge. I was only taught Python in ICS 111 and 211, and it does not translate too well. JavaScript was a whole other language, and I had no clue how to do anything. The last time I took an ICS course where we were coding anything was about four semesters ago so to say I was rusty on coding in general was an understatement. Going through the “Basic JavaScript” on FreeCodeCamp was a struggle for me, and I probably still have some areas I need to review even after I’ve completed it.</p>

<h2 id="serving-its-purpose">Serving its Purpose</h2>

<p>Even though I am still getting into the grove of things, I would say that there are a lot of benefits to using JavaScript in terms of Software Engineering. JavaScript treats functions as first class, meaning all functions are treated as variables instead of taken as an argument or returned as a result. Python, for example, is a higher-order function. Though I learned PEMDAS in elementary school, having higher order functions makes things a bit trickier in college, especially in ICS 314. In a way, first class functions allow for more creativity for Software Engineering. For someone who got a bad grade on their “Classes” assignment back in 111, I can say this was a nice breath of fresh air.</p>

<h2 id="failure--never-trying">Failure &gt; Never Trying</h2>

<p>JavaScript being a totally new language to me was very scary. At first, I kind of gave up because it was difficult to troubleshoot, and I was very discouraged. Building confidence in the language was all it took for me to give it another shot. Failures are not necessarily a bad thing; they are a way for me to learn more. I was never an athlete but doing exercises to understand JavaScript felt like a workout to me! Computer Athleticism is real, and it’s something I need to build a habit of doing for basically the rest of my life. Learning and growing only happens if I have the discipline to stick to it, even if it means failing once in a while.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-the-unknown">Navigating the Unknown</h2>

<p>Coming from a very shaky Python background, I was and still kind of am a little uncertain about everything. I went from using “int ()” and “float ()” to things like var, let, or const. All these transitions are literally like learning a new language to me! I was unprepared to say the least. One of the most famous lines I see frequently in code is:
for (let i=0; i&lt;str.length; i++). 
I could not figure this out for the life of me. However, after a simple google search and some more practice, it made sense. “i=0” means you’re starting at zero, computer counts starting at zero (I have made the mistake of starting at one more than I’d like to admit). “i&lt;str.length” with ‘str.length’ being replaceable by any function or number, means the end. In the case of the ‘str.length’, it means you end at the length of the string so that your code does not keep going on for infinity. “i++” simply means you want to go through the string or function, whatever it may be, one by one or number by number. Learning to navigate has been difficult, but using resources to better understand it is not something to be embarrassed about.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>JavaScript is foreign to me, and there is much more for me to learn. I may have to fail a few WODs to get the hang of it, but it only encourages me to study harder or learn more for the next one. There are many times I am and will be discouraged, but I need to remember to stay concentrated, try my best, and keep learning. Failure is one step closer to success.</p>
