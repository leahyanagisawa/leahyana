*WODs are in class assesments that determine if the student has learned the material taught in class that week, it is graded as a pass or fail format.*

On the first day of class, we were told about WODs or Workout of the Days that would happen once a week, to test our comprehension of what we learned from that week of class. The kicker was this: it was timed and each WOD was worth 100 points, and it was pass or fail. I thought alright, study here and there and make sure I know the material, piece of cake. Boy did I have my work cut out for me. 

## The Prep Work

In order to succeed on the WODs, we were instructed to:
1. Put in 2 hours everyday, 5 days a week for this class alone.
2. Ensure we were working during our high functioning period of the day.
3. Study and take notes of all material provided.
4. Practicing and repracticing all practice WODs assigned to us.
5. Attend the TAʻs WOD practices, which is outside of class time.
6. Ask smart questions in order to actually learn.

If you ask me, this is a lot to ask from one class, given that the average student has at least four other classes they have to take simultaneously. Getting into a routine was a little difficult for me personally. I definitely did not prepare nearly as much as I shouldʻve for this first WOD, but to be fair this was also my first time getting used to the schedule of five other classes. I thought I prepared enough. I studied the practice WODs, I attended the TAʻs WOD, and I did all the assignments required of me. All that was apparently not enough.

## The Day of Doom

Walking into class, I was so nervous. I kept thinking it was going to be hard and I wasnʻt going to even finish before the time was up. As the WOD was released to us, I began reading it and thinking wow this did not seem too hard at all. The instructions gave all that was needed, all I had to do was put it in JavaScript langugae and I would be good. I finished before the time was up and I felt okay about the work I submitted. I understood what I was doing and I didnʻt need assistance on any part. I thought if anything going forward, I would spend a little less time on test running and more time on just double checking if I closed all of my brackets.

## The Discussion to Follow

After everyone finished the WOD, we discussed what we did. Some people chose to use a loop and others didnʻt. We saw how both ways worked out and how both had their flaws. It was easier in my eyes to use a for loop for this particular WOD just because thatʻs what I was most comfortable doing. It was easy for me to see how it counted from 1 to 100 within a loop rather than structuring it without one. I think I would still have done it in a for loop if I had to go back and redo it just because it helped me visualize it better. When discussing other methods, I was a little confused on how it all came together. The review afterwards was a wake up call that I needed to better understand all concepts taught within the week and not just try to perfect my skills in the area I felt most comfortable in. 

## My Afterthoughts

Walking out of that class, I felt okay. I knew I need to study more, prepare myself better, and not just settle for knowing how to do something. I was hard on myself and studied more afterwards to make sure I grasped concepts better and didnʻt just try to get away with doing what was in my comfort zone. I definitely felt that this first WOD was a struggle to learn from. I went in there stressed, got a little to confident doing it, and quickly got humbled during the after conversation. I now realize itʻs not enough to read or watch videos, listen blindly to lectures, or even just attend WOD practice sessions. While all of these are great, I wasnʻt learning. I was only listening. A lot of it is being more open to learning rather than having the mindset of I donʻt need to know everything to do good. I think I was striving for mediocrity when this class required me to strive for beyond. The discussion our class had after the WOD was complete was important. It highlighted what we did well as well as emphasizing there mightʻve been better, faster, or just other ways in general to approach the issue.

I learned a lot from this first WOD experience. It will be lessons I need to learn from and also some small successes I will keep practicing to keep good habits. Though I still donʻt totally agree with WODs being pass or fail as it leaves no grey area from a points/grade perspective, I totally get that WODs are similar to real life projects: you either do it successfully or you donʻt. I hope I only go up from here.
